#By itself, the distribution of age does not tell us much other than that there are no outliers as all the ages are reasonable.
#To visualize the effect of the age on the target, we will next make a kernel density estimation plot (KDE) colored by the value of the target. A kernel density estimate plot shows the distribution of a single variable and can be thought of as a smoothed histogram (it is created by computing a kernel, usually a Gaussian, at each data point and then averaging all the individual kernels to develop a single smooth curve). We will use the seaborn kdeplot for this graph.
#KERNEL DENSITY PLOT
plt.figure(figsize = (10, 8))
# KDE plot of loans that were repaid on time
sns.kdeplot(app_train.loc[app_train['TARGET'] == 0, 'DAYS_BIRTH'] / 365, label = 'target == 0')

# KDE plot of loans which were not repaid on time
sns.kdeplot(app_train.loc[app_train['TARGET'] == 1, 'DAYS_BIRTH'] / 365, label = 'target == 1')

# Labeling of plot
plt.xlabel('Age (years)'); plt.ylabel('Density'); plt.title('Distribution of Ages');



#######Polynomial Features (combine 2 features in various ways and see the coorelation with target)
#n this method, we make features that are powers of existing features as well as interaction terms between existing features. For example, we can create variables EXT_SOURCE_1^2 and EXT_SOURCE_2^2 and also variables such as EXT_SOURCE_1 x EXT_SOURCE_2, EXT_SOURCE_1 x EXT_SOURCE_2^2, EXT_SOURCE_1^2 x  EXT_SOURCE_2^2, and so on.
